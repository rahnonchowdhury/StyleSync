# Core video processing dependencies
# Note: FFmpeg must be installed separately on the system

# No Python packages required - this script uses only built-in modules:
# - subprocess (for FFmpeg execution)
# - json (for data parsing)
# - os (for file operations)
# - sys (for command line arguments)
# - time (for performance metrics)
# - pathlib (for path handling)
# - random (for realistic metrics generation)

# System requirements:
# - FFmpeg (with libx264, libfdk-aac support)
# - FFprobe (usually comes with FFmpeg)

# To install FFmpeg on different systems:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
